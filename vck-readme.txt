Visit the VCK home page at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/vck/ for some
background information. From there, get my poster for a quick introduction
and the original paper by Naor & Shamir for all the theoretical background.

If you don't have them already, get PIL from http://www.pythonware.com/ and
Python from http://www.python.org (or, if you're on win 32, get both in a
convenient precompiled package from Pythonware -- this is what I've used to
develop this module and the only PIL implementation I've ever worked with).


To play around with your own pictures: run 

   python vck-split-mono.py mypicture.tif

to have mypicture.tif (which must be a 1-bit-deep bitmap, but doesn't have
to be tif) split into two bitmap "shares" that will recreate the original
when superimposed. (You must photocopy them onto transparency first.) The
program will not only generate the two shares as files but will also
display them in little windows for you. It will also show a third window
with what you should ideally obtain by overlapping the transparencies.

Note that, due to limitations in the process of photocopying onto
transparency, the best results are obtained with comparatively low
resolution pictures (of the order of 50 pixels across), since these suffer
less from alignment problems.


For greyscale, do

   python vck-split-grey.py mypicture.tif

to have mypicture.tif (which now must be a 256-bit-deep greyscale image,
but again doesn't have to be tif) split into two postscript "shares".


For more experiments (including viewing the intermediate results and so on)
run

    python vck.py

on its own; it will perform one of its many self-tests/demos. To choose
another one, edit the source (you can do this even if you don't speak
Python) and, at the very bottom of vck.py, in the bit that looks like this...

if __name__ == "__main__":
#    mainApp(testBooleanOps)
    mainApp(testEncryptDecrypt)
#    mainApp(testAllIntermediateValues)
#    mainApp(testGrey)
#    mainApp(testSplitImage)
#    mainApp(testSplitImageG)

...add a # to the mainApp line that doesn't have one, and remove it from
another one of your choice. (Be sure NOT to insert any tab characters in
the file or you may regret it.)


To peek under the hood: read the source code, which contains lots of
documentation.
