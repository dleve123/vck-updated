"""The vck.py module (Visual Cryptography Kit,
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/vck/) implements the primitives of visual
cryptography.

For more on visual cryptography read the seminal paper by Naor and Shamir
(1994), available from
http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/vis.ps.

The purpose of the kit is to let the reader explore this fascinating idea
in a practical hands-on fashion. The user can play around with her own
pictures, see the intermediate results of the various operations and
combine the operations in the desired way using her own python script.

Readability of the source code was a primary goal and many image
manipulation operations are implemented with very little respect for
efficiency, with the aim of simply making the algorithms obvious. It is not
expected that this kit will be used for actual encryption and so
facilitating exploration and exporting an obvious API was deemed to be more
important than making the program fast.
